/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 *
 * D-Fence — Lab 4 §3.2 and US-0.5: the two §10.1 obligations that needed the client to exist.
 *
 * `tests/performance.test.ts` recorded 10.1.1 and 10.1.4 as **not measured here**, because both are
 * about what a browser does and there was no browser-side anything to measure. E10 delivered the
 * screens and they are now served, so the block is gone and these are the measurements.
 *
 * **What is measured, stated precisely, because the honest scope is narrower than the requirement.**
 * jsdom builds a DOM and runs React; it performs no layout and paints no pixels. So what is bounded
 * here is *mount and reconciliation* — the part that grows with the number of clusters and the part
 * a careless render turns quadratic — plus the transfer time of the bundle at the stated bandwidth,
 * computed from the real byte sizes. What is **not** measured is layout, paint and compositing on
 * a real device. §5 of the test plan records that as needing a human with a phone, and no number
 * here should be read as closing it.
