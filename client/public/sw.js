/**
 * D-Fence — service worker.
 * Traces: 11.8.7, 11.8.8, 11.8.10, 11.8.11.
 *
 * The whole of the offline story, in one file with no build step of its own. `__BUILD__` is
 * replaced by `client/build.mjs` with a hash of the bundle, which is what makes 11.8.11 work: a
 * deployment changes the hash, the cache name changes with it, and `activate` deletes every cache
 * that is not the current one. A fixed cache name is how an installed application ends up serving
 * a version of itself that no longer exists on the server, with no way for the user to escape it
 * short of clearing site data.
 *
 * **Nothing under `/api/` is ever cached (11.8.10).** A cached cluster count would be presented by
 * a screen that also claims, under 7.1.9, to be showing how fresh its data is — so the caching
 * would not merely be stale, it would make a true statement false. The shell is cacheable because
 * it is inert: HTML, CSS and a bundle that render nothing until they have fetched something.
 *
 * **Network first, cache as the fallback.** The opposite (cache first) is faster and is what most
 * service-worker examples do, but it serves the previous bundle to a user who is online, which is
 * exactly the failure that makes teams distrust service workers. Here the cache is what the
 * network cannot supply, and nothing more.
