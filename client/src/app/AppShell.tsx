/**
 * D-Fence — application shell and navigation.
 * Stereotype: <<boundary>>. Traces: 11.1.1–11.1.10, 10.5.1, 10.5.6.
 *
 * The shell owns three things and no more: the chrome around a screen, the guard decision for the
 * current URL, and the sign-out control. It renders **no domain content** — every screen does its
 * own fetching — so that adding a screen never means editing this file.
 *
 * It also carries the two application-wide mobile affordances (§11.8), for the same reason it
 * carries the navigation: they belong to the application rather than to any screen. The install
 * control appears only while installation is possible and disappears once it has happened; the
 * offline banner appears only while the device says it is offline. Neither is a screen, and
 * neither may push a screen's content down when it is absent — so both render nothing at all
 * rather than an empty element.

   * thirty clusters, a crew member holds a phone in one hand in the rain — so the shell honours it.
   *
   * It is an attribute rather than three blocks of JSX because the markup underneath is genuinely
   * the same: a brand, a set of links, an account block. Only the arrangement differs, and
   * arrangement is the stylesheet's job. `data-chrome="bar"` still collapses to the bottom bar
   * under the phone breakpoint, so a manager on a phone is not stranded.
