/**
 * D-Fence — the client-side route guard.
 * Traces: 11.1.9, 11.1.10, 10.5.6, 2.3.3–2.3.7.
 *
 * **This guard is a convenience, not a security control.** 2.3.6 requires every access rule to be
 * enforced on the server independently of any interface control, and it is — see
 * `AccessControlService`. What this adds is that a user never lands on a screen they cannot use and
 * then reads an error: 10.5.6 asks for the interface to prevent the dead end, not to be the lock.
 *
 * Stating that plainly matters, because a guard that looks like a security boundary invites the
 * next contributor to skip the server check "since the client already handles it".
