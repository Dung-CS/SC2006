/**
 * D-Fence — the client's entry point.
 * Stereotype: <<boundary>>. Traces: 11.1.1–11.1.10, 11.3.2, 2.1.8, 2.3.6, 2.3.7.
 *
 * Everything else in `client/` was compiled and unit-tested but never **run**: there was no
 * `index.html`, no bundle and no mount, so twenty-seven screens existed and nothing served them.
 * This file is the whole of what was missing, and it is deliberately small — it owns the three
 * pieces of state a single-page application cannot avoid and nothing else.
 *
 * 1. **The URL**, mirrored into React state and kept in step with the browser's history. The back
 *    button has to work, and it only does if every navigation goes through `pushState` and every
 *    `popstate` comes back into the same state.
 * 2. **The principal**, which is who is signed in. The *token* is persisted (see
 *    `SessionPersistence`, which explains why 2.1.9 requires it); the *principal* is not, and is
 *    re-fetched from `/api/auth/me` on every load so that a role can never be edited into
 *    existence in the developer console.
 * 3. **One `ApiClient`**, constructed once and given the 403 handler, so that a refusal anywhere in
 *    the application lands on Not Authorised without every screen remembering to check.
 *
 * The router is the route table plus the guard, both of which already existed and are already
 * checked against the dialog map. Nothing here decides what a role may see: the guard is a
 * convenience, 2.3.6 is enforced on the server, and a 403 still arrives and is still shown.
