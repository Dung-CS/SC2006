/**
 * D-Fence — the session token across a page load.
 * Stereotype: <<boundary>>. Traces: 2.1.8, 2.1.9, 2.1.12, 10.5.6, 11.1.10.
 *
 * The token used to live in a React `useState` and nowhere else, and the comment that put it there
 * cited 2.1.8. Reading 2.1.8 again, it says only that a token is *issued*; it says nothing about
 * where the client keeps it. The requirement that actually bears on this is **2.1.9**, which gives
 * a session twenty-four hours of inactivity before it expires — and a session that dies when the
 * user presses F5 cannot express a twenty-four hour window at all. So the in-memory-only choice
 * was not implementing 2.1.8, it was quietly contradicting 2.1.9.
 *
 * **What is stored is the token and nothing else.** Not the role, not the account id. Those come
 * back from `GET /api/auth/me` on every restore, because a role read out of `localStorage` is a
 * role the user can edit with the developer console, and a client that trusts it has moved an
 * access decision off the server in violation of 2.3.6. Restoring costs one round trip; the
 * alternative costs the guard its meaning.
 *
 * The restore is therefore a *server* operation: the token is a claim, and `/api/auth/me` is what
 * adjudicates it. An expired token (2.1.9), a signed-out token (2.1.12) and a token from a
 * database that has since been reseeded all fail the same way and are all cleared the same way.
 *
 * `localStorage` and not `sessionStorage`: 2.1.9's twenty-four hours outlive a tab, and a
 * `sessionStorage` token would be dropped by the browser well before the server dropped the
 * session — the client would sign the user out on a schedule the requirement does not describe.
