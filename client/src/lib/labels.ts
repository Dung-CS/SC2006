/**
 * D-Fence — what the enums are called in front of a person.
 * Traces: 11.7.x (the screens are read by residents), 10.5.3, 4.1.26.
 *
 * **The single most common UI defect in this application was an identifier on a screen.** A
 * resident's own report was headed `StandingWater`; the Staff table said `CleaningCrew`; the
 * dispatch list suggested `RefuseClearance`; the score breakdown listed `DaysSinceLastTreatment`,
 * `PremisesMix` and `CaseGrowthDelta` as if a town council officer should know what those are; and
 * a saved location's status read `CLEAR`. Every one of those is the TypeScript member name reaching
 * the browser because `{value}` renders whatever it is handed.
 *
 * So the mapping lives here, once, rather than as a `toLowerCase()` or a regex sprinkled through
 * twenty screens. Three rules hold throughout:
 *
 *   - **Sentence case, not Title Case.** "Standing water", not "Standing Water" — these are things,
 *     not proper nouns, and Title Case in running text reads like a product name.
 *   - **A unit belongs to its number, never to its label.** `unit()` is where "mm", "cases" and
 *     "days" are decided, so a driver row cannot show `0.526` with no idea what it measures.
 *   - **Nothing here invents meaning.** Where a name is genuinely opaque — `PremisesMix` — the
 *     label is the plain-English expansion the requirement uses, and the explanation goes in
 *     `driverHelp`, which screens show beside it rather than instead of it.
 *
 * A missing entry falls back to `spaced()`, which splits the camel case. That is deliberately not
 * an exception: a new enum member should render as "Response capacity deficit" rather than crash a
 * screen, and the fallback being *almost* right is what makes the missing entry easy to see.
