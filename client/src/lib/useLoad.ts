/**
 * D-Fence — a GET as a `LoadState`, for screens.
 * Traces: 11.4.1–11.4.4, 10.2.2, 10.5.7.
 *
 * `ApiClient.load` already turns a fetch into a state; this adds the three things a *screen* needs
 * and a plain call cannot give it: the initial `loading` render, a `retry` for 11.4.4, and the
 * guard against a response arriving after the user has navigated away.
 *
 * That last one is not defensive padding. Without it, a slow request from a screen the user has
 * left calls `setState` on an unmounted component, and — worse than the warning — the *previous*
 * screen's data can land in the current one when two requests race.

   *
   * - **A failed tick is discarded, not shown.** The screen is already displaying good data. One
   *   dropped request replacing a working queue with an error page would be strictly worse than
   *   the stale row it was trying to correct; the next tick will either succeed or the user will
   *   press something and get the error honestly.
   * - **Nothing is polled while the tab is hidden.** A phone in a pocket is the normal state of a
   *   crew member's device, and a background tab polling all afternoon spends their battery and
   *   the B1's request budget on frames nobody sees.
   * - **A tab that becomes visible again re-fetches immediately** rather than waiting out the rest
   *   of its interval, because the moment the user looks back at the screen is exactly the moment
   *   a stale row matters.
