/**
 * D-Fence — Job Completion (REQUIREMENTS.md 11.2.21).
 * Stereotype: <<boundary>>. Traces: 11.2.21, 8.3.6, 8.3.7, 8.3.16, 11.5.x, 11.6.x, 10.5.3.
 *
 * 8.3.6 requires at least one photograph, and 8.3.7 refuses a completion without one, and the submit button says so before it is pressed
 * rather than after. This is the screen used standing in a drain in the rain, on a phone, and a
 * form that accepted the notes and then refused for a reason it knew about from the start is the
 * form that costs someone a second trip.
 *
 * The task performed is **not** a field. The server takes it from the work order (8.3.7), so a
 * crew member cannot record having done something nobody asked for. Showing it read-only here says
 * what is being recorded without inviting a change that would be ignored.
