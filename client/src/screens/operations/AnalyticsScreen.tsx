/**
 * D-Fence — Analytics (REQUIREMENTS.md 11.2.26).
 * Stereotype: <<boundary>>. Traces: 11.2.26, 7.3.1–7.3.5, 10.5.3, 10.5.7, 11.4.1–11.4.4, 11.7.5.
 *
 * `AnalyticsController` has built all five §7.3 visualisations for some time, `GET
 * /api/ops/analytics` has answered with all five, and no screen rendered any of them — so the work
 * was done and unreachable. This file is only the display; every number below is computed on the
 * server, because 7.3.1 and 7.3.5 read thirty days of snapshots and shipping those to a browser to
 * be counted would put the §10.1 read budget on the network.
 *
 * **The sufficiency statement is the point of this screen, not a caveat on it.** The controller
 * returns `sufficient` and, when false, a sentence saying what is missing. A chart drawn without it
 * makes a claim the data does not support — three days of snapshots drawn as a 30-day series reads
 * as "cases are steady", and a median over one work order reads as "a job takes six hours". So the
 * insufficiency is rendered *above* each chart, in words, in the same visual weight as the chart
 * itself. It is never a footnote, never grey-on-grey, and never colour alone (11.7.5).
 *
 * **The charts are drawn in SVG and HTML, with no charting library.** Three reasons, in order of
 * weight. A library would be the largest dependency in the project for five charts. The §10.1
 * bundle budget is measured, and the current bundle is 208 KB. And a `<table>` behind every series
 * is what makes these readable to a screen reader at all — 11.7.5 asks for more than a picture, and
 * a canvas-based chart gives a screen reader nothing whatsoever. The SVG is decorative
 * (`aria-hidden`); the table is the content.
