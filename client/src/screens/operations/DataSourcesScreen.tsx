/**
 * D-Fence — Data Sources (REQUIREMENTS.md 11.2.23).
 * Stereotype: <<boundary>>. Traces: 11.2.23, 1.1.18, 1.4.1–1.4.4, 10.2.2, 10.5.7, 11.7.5.
 *
 * The screen that says whether the numbers on every other screen can be trusted today.
 *
 * Two states are shown, and they are deliberately different bars. `isWarning` (1.4.3) means three
 * consecutive failures or three of the source's own intervals without a success — an alarm.
 * `isStale` (1.4.4) means the data is older than one interval — a marker on the data, not an
 * alarm. Collapsing them would either cry wolf on every missed cycle or stay silent through a
 * dead feed, and the whole value of this screen is telling those two apart.
 *
 * "Never succeeded" is rendered as its own sentence rather than as a very old timestamp: 1.4.1
 * distinguishes them, and "last success: never" is a different problem from "last success: Tuesday".
 *
 * 1.1.18's manual run lives here rather than on the dashboard because this is the screen a manager
 * is already on when they want it: a source has just been reported as failing, and the question
 * "is it back?" should be answerable without waiting an hour for the next scheduled cycle.
