/**
 * D-Fence — the four presentation primitives every detail screen was missing.
 * Traces: 11.4.x, 11.7.x, 5.3.4, 8.3.6, 10.3.5. Design: lab4/TEST-PLAN.md §6.17.
 *
 * **What this file is a response to.** A pass over photographs of all twenty-eight screens found
 * the same shape on nearly every one of them: a column of `<p data-part="…">` elements, one fact
 * per line, each rendered as undifferentiated body text with no label. Report Review read

 *     Submitted
 *     Jln Kayu / Jln Tari Dulang, Payong, …
 *     UAT — standing water in a disused pot behind the void deck.
 *     Submitted 2026-09-04 06:42

 *
 * — six facts, five of which the reader has to infer the *name* of from the value. Every one of
 * those screens passes its tests, because a test asks whether the text is present and it is.
 *
 * So rather than restyle twenty screens, four components:
 *
 *   - `Facts` — a real `<dl>`. The label is the thing that was missing, and a definition list is
 *     what a labelled fact *is*, so screen readers get it for free.
 *   - `Pill` — the tier/status chip. The Figma direction is emphatic that a tier is "ALWAYS a text
 *     label plus colour, never colour alone", and the dispatch list was tinting the locality name
 *     and calling that the tier.
 *   - `PhotoGrid` — images, as images. See its own comment: this is the half of the photograph
 *     story that had no route behind it until `ImageRoutes` was written.
 *   - `Sparkline` — a number's history as a shape. The charts drew a bare polyline with no axis and
 *     then printed the same thirty numbers underneath in a table, which is not a chart with a
 *     table, it is a table with a decoration.

/**
 * One photograph, fetched through a link that expires.

 * **Why an extra request per image.** 10.3.5 requires photographs to be served only through
 * authenticated, non-enumerable URLs, so there is no `src` a screen can simply compose: the key
 * names an object in a private bucket, and `GET /api/images/…` is what turns a key the caller is
 * authorised for into a five-minute link. The alternative — proxying the bytes through the
 * application — puts five megabytes per photograph through a Node process for no gain.
 *
 * The link is fetched on mount and never cached across a reload, so its expiry is not something a
 * user meets. If it cannot be fetched the tile says why, in words: a broken-image icon tells the
 * manager nothing, and "no longer stored" and "you are not permitted to see this" are different
 * facts they may need to act on.
