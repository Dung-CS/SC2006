/**
 * D-Fence — the navigation glyphs.
 * Stereotype: <<boundary>>. Traces: 11.1.1–11.1.4, 11.7.5, 11.8.x.
 *
 * The Figma screens draw every navigation item as an 18×18 stroked glyph beside its label, and the
 * phone screens draw a 22×22 one above it. These are those glyphs, transcribed from the design
 * file's own inline SVG rather than pulled from an icon package — the design ships them as paths,
 * so a dependency would only be a way of getting something slightly different.
 *
 * **The glyph is never the label.** 11.7.5 forbids carrying meaning in appearance alone, and an
 * icon is exactly that. Every item renders its word too; `aria-hidden` here says so to a screen
 * reader, which would otherwise announce a decorative shape between two useful ones. The bottom
 * bar on a phone shrinks the word, it does not drop it.
 *
 * `stroke="currentColor"` throughout, so the active/inactive colouring is decided once in the
 * stylesheet by the same rule that colours the label, and the two can never disagree.
