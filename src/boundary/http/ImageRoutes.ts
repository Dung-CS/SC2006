/**
 * D-Fence — ImageRoutes.
 * Stereotype: <<boundary>>. Traces: 5.1.5, 5.3.5, 8.3.6, 10.3.5, 10.5.3, 2.3.4, 11.2.10, 11.2.15.
 *
 * Routes:
 *   GET /api/images/report/:reportId/:key      → { url, expiresInSeconds }   (11.2.10, 11.2.15)
 *   GET /api/images/completion-evidence/:key   → { url, expiresInSeconds }   (8.3.6, 2.3.4)
 *
 * **The half of the photograph story that was never built.** `UploadRoutes` carried images in;
 * `ObjectStorage.signedUrl` was written, implemented twice and unit-tested; and no route, no
 * controller and no screen ever called it. So every photograph in the system was write-only. The
 * Report Review screen — whose own comment says "a manager sees the photographs; this is the
 * screen they exist for" — rendered `<li>{photo.filename}</li>`, a list of names a resident's
 * phone happened to choose. 5.3.4 was being reported as met by a screen showing `IMG_4821.jpg`.
 *
 * **The route answers a URL, not the bytes**, exactly as `UploadRoutes` said it would: the browser
 * fetches the image straight from object storage over a link that expires, so the application
 * never proxies five megabytes per photograph, and 10.3.5's "authenticated, non-enumerable" holds.
 *
 * **Why a report photograph is addressed by report and key, not by key alone.** Who may see a
 * report photograph is not a property of the image — it is a rule about the *report*, and there
 * are two of them:
 *
 *   - **5.3.4** gives a moderator every photograph on a report awaiting review. That is the whole
 *     point of the review: a manager decides whether standing water is really standing water by
 *     looking at the picture of it, before the report has any status but Submitted.
 *   - **5.3.5** withholds a photograph from every *other* resident until the report has been
 *     triaged, and gives the reporter their own back at any time.
 *
 * Both are already implemented, once each — 5.3.4 in `ModerationController.review`, 5.3.5 in
 * `ReportController.publicView` — and the only way to ask either is to name the report. So this
 * handler asks whichever one governs the caller, and mints a link only for a key that came back in
 * the answer. A resident who guesses another resident's key gets a 404, because the key is not in
 * *their* view of that report.
 *
 * The first version of this file asked `publicView` for everybody, which quietly applied 5.3.5 to
 * the moderator: the Report Review screen fetched a link for a photograph the server had just sent
 * it and was told the photograph was not part of the report. A screenshot is what caught it — the
 * tests pass either way, because both paths are correct code doing the wrong thing.
 *
 * Completion evidence is different and stays key-addressed: 2.3.4 gives every work order to the
 * Operations Manager, so there is no per-object rule to consult.
