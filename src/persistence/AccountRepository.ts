/**
 * D-Fence — AccountRepository and SessionRepository.
 * Stereotype: <<persistence>>. Traces: 2.1.1–2.1.12, 2.2.3–2.2.5, 2.3.x, 6.1.6, 10.4.3.
 *
 * Implements `AccountStore` and `SessionStore` against Postgres.
 *
 * **These two were not optional once reports and work orders moved.** `report.reporter_id` and
 * `work_order.assignee_id` are real foreign keys into `account`, so with accounts still held in
 * memory the database refused every report a resident filed and every assignment a manager made —
 * a 500 rather than a silent wrong answer, which is the constraint doing its job. Persisting the
 * two aggregates without persisting the people they point at is not a half-migration, it is a
 * broken one.
 *
 * **What still does not survive a restart is the credential.** `LocalAuthProvider` holds the scrypt
 * hashes in memory, because it is the development stand-in for Supabase Auth (10.3.1: the provider
 * owns the credential, never this schema — there is no password column here and there must not be).
 * So after a restart the accounts, their roles, their lock-outs and their Telegram links are all
 * still here and a sign-in fails until the provider is the real one. That is stated rather than
 * papered over.
