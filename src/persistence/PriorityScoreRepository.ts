 * Stereotype: <<persistence>>. Traces: 4.1.10, 4.1.11, 4.1.12, 4.1.14, 7.2.1, 7.2.6.
 *
 * Scores are **history, not a current value**. 4.1.11 keeps every cycle's result and 7.2.1 forbids
 * the dashboard recomputing for display, so this table is append-only in practice: `latest()` is
 * "the most recent computed_at", never "the row we overwrote".
 *
 * The breakdown is stored rather than recomputed (4.1.10). A dashboard that recomputed a
 * contribution would show a number that never existed in the history, and the two would drift the
 * first time a weight changed.
