/**
 * D-Fence — ReportRepository.
 * Stereotype: <<persistence>>. Traces: 5.1.1–5.1.14, 5.2.1–5.2.9, 5.3.1–5.3.5, 7.3.5, 4.1.3, 8.3.21.
 *
 * Implements the same `ReportStore` port as `InMemoryReportStore`, so `ReportController` and
 * `ModerationController` cannot tell which one they have.
 *
 * **The duplicate check is the reason this class is worth writing.** 5.1.11 asks for open reports
 * of the same type within fifty metres of a point in the last twenty-four hours. In memory that is
 * a linear scan over every report ever submitted, which is fine at a hundred and useless at a
 * hundred thousand; here it is `ST_DWithin` over a GIST index on a `geography` column, so the
 * radius is stated in **metres** — the unit 5.1.11 is actually written in. On a `geometry` column
 * the same call would take degrees and fifty metres would silently become about five and a half
 * million.
 *
 * `ST_DWithin` is inclusive of the radius, which matches `InMemoryReportStore`'s `<=` and the Lab 4
 * boundary cases at 49, 50 and 51 metres. The two implementations have to agree exactly at 50 m or
 * the tests are testing the store rather than the rule.
