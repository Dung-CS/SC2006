/**
 * D-Fence — ObservationRepository, OperatorRegistryRepository and ReferralRepository.
 * Stereotype: <<persistence>>. Traces: 1.5.9, 1.5.10, 1.5.11, 1.6.5, 1.6.6, 1.6.7, 1.6.8,
 * 4.1.24, 8.6.1, 8.6.4, 8.6.7, 8.6.8, 10.2.3, 10.6.3.
 *
 * Migration 005 created `observation_record`, `vector_control_operator`, `geocode_cache` and
 * `referral` on 2026-09-17. Until now nothing wrote to any of them: `server.ts` bound all three
 * ports to their in-memory implementations, so the tables existed and stayed empty while the data
 * lived in three `Map`s inside the process.
 *
 * What that cost, per store:
 *
 *   - **Observations.** 1.5.11 makes the supplier's observation id the key so that overlapping
 *     ingestion runs do not count the same sighting twice. Held in memory, the deduplication was
 *     real only within one container lifetime: every restart re-admitted the entire window, and
 *     `ExternalObservationDensity` counted records it had already counted. The driver is capped at
 *     0.20, so this did not look like a fault — it looked like activity.
 *   - **The operator registry.** 1.6.5 caches 290 geocodes precisely so a reload costs nothing the
 *     second time. In memory it was discarded on every restart, and each one meant 290 OneMap
 *     round trips to rebuild a file that is published once and had not changed.
 *   - **Referrals.** The worst of the three. 8.6.6 tells a resident their report has gone to an
 *     authority; 8.6.7 shows the report as referred rather than as having an open work order. A
 *     restart erased the referral and left the report in a state whose explanation no longer
 *     existed — the resident had been told something the system could no longer confirm.
