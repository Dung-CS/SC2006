/**
 * D-Fence — CrossPestScoringService.
 * Stereotype: <<control>>. Traces: 4.1.22-4.1.26, 4.2.1-4.2.4, 4.3.4-4.3.6, 4.4.3, 1.5.9, 1.6.8.
 *
 * Scores every (locality, pest) pair that has evidence, for every pest except the mosquito.
 *
 * **Why the mosquito is excluded, explicitly.** `PriorityScoringEngine` is the tier A cycle and is
 * what 4.2.5's frozen goldens were cut from. Scoring the mosquito here as well would produce two
 * scores for the same subject in one cycle, from two code paths, and the one that happened to be
 * written second would win. One subject, one scorer.
 *
 * **What counts as evidence.** A pest is scored in a locality when that locality has at least one
 * report of it, or at least one admitted observation of it. The alternative — scoring all 22 pests
 * in every locality every cycle — would publish a ranked queue of several hundred rows, almost all
 * of them zero, and 7.2.x would show an Operations Manager a screenful of nothing. A pair with no
 * evidence is not a low priority; it is not a subject.
