/**
 * D-Fence — the permitted moves of a report through its status set.
 * Stereotype: <<control>>. Traces: 5.2.1–5.2.7, 8.3.21, 8.5.1.
 *
 * Same shape as `WorkOrderTransitionTable`, and for the same reason: a table can be read against
 * the requirement it came from, whereas a switch statement spread over three controllers cannot.
 *
 * The difference from the work-order table is `actor`. A report moves for two very different
 * reasons — a moderator decides (5.2.3), or a linked work order progressed (5.2.6, 5.2.7) — and
 * conflating them would let a manager mark a report Closed by hand without any work being done.
 * SYSTEM moves are reachable only from the §8 hooks, never from a route.
