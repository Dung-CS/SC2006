/**
 * D-Fence — the health of every external data source.
 * Stereotype: <<control>>. Traces: 1.4.1, 1.4.2, 1.4.3, 1.4.4, 3.1.16, 7.5.1, 10.2.2.
 *
 * Split out of `DashboardController` because 1.4.x is a feature of its own and was being answered
 * by four lines inside a dashboard method that got two things wrong:
 *
 *  1. **It warned after ONE failed run.** 1.4.3 says three consecutive scheduled intervals. A
 *     public API returning a 503 once is normal; warning on it trains a manager to ignore the
 *     panel, which is the failure mode that matters — an alarm nobody reads is worse than no alarm.
 *  2. **It reported two sources out of four.** Clusters and rainfall were listed; the forecast and
 *     the geocoder were not, so 1.4.1's "every external data source" was two-thirds true. A source
 *     missing from a health panel does not look unhealthy, it looks fine.
 *
 * **Two conditions, not one.** A source is warned on when *either* its three most recent runs all
 * failed, *or* nothing has succeeded for three of its scheduled intervals. Both are needed and
 * neither implies the other: a source that fails three times has three FAILED rows, but a source
 * whose scheduler has stopped firing altogether has **no rows at all** — and that is the outage a
 * failure counter is structurally unable to see.
