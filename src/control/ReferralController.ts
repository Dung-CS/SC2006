/**
 * D-Fence — referral to an external authority.
 * Stereotype: <<control>>. Traces: 8.6.1–8.6.11, 8.1.14, 8.1.15, 4.2.3, 11.2.28.
 *
 * The control class for the thing D-Fence declines to do. A wildlife case is not dispatched to a
 * Cleaning Crew — 8.1.14 refuses the work order — and this is what happens instead: the case goes to
 * the authority the pest profile names, the resident is told who it went to, and the outcome comes
 * back and closes the report.
 *
 * **What it deliberately does not do.** It writes no `WorkOrder` (8.6.10) and no `TreatmentRecord`
 * (8.6.11). The temptation is real — the case is closed, after all — and giving in to it would tell
 * `DaysSinceLastTreatment` that a locality was treated when nobody treated it, which corrupts the
 * 4.1.17 feedback loop that makes a score fall after work is done.
