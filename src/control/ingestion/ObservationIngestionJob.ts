/**
 * D-Fence — ObservationIngestionJob (Template Method).
 * Stereotype: <<control>>. Traces: 1.5.1, 1.5.8–1.5.14, 10.2.2, 10.2.4.
 *
 * One job per pest type, not one job for all of them. 1.5.2 makes the supplier call taxon-by-taxon
 * anyway, and 1.5.14 wants the pest type recorded on the run — a combined job would have to write a
 * run record naming six pests, from which nobody could tell which of them actually returned data.
 *
 * What the template gives for free is the part that matters most here: on failure, `run()` marks
 * the source stale and records the failure **without touching stored data**, which is 1.5.13 (serve
 * the most recently stored observations) satisfied structurally rather than by remembering to.
