/**
 * D-Fence — DashboardController.
 * Stereotype: <<control>>. Traces: 7.1.1–7.1.9, 7.2.1–7.2.9, 7.3.2, 7.4.2, 7.4.3, 7.5.1, 2.3.4.
 *
 * Assembles what the Operations Manager sees. Three rules shape it:
 *
 * 1. **It reads stored scores; it never rescores for display** (7.2.1). A dashboard that recomputed
 *    would show numbers that never existed in the history 4.1.11 keeps, and the two would drift.
 * 2. **A count that cannot be computed yet is `null`, not 0.** Reports do not exist yet, and a zero
 *    would read as "none outstanding" — a false all-clear on the panel whose whole job is to raise
 *    attention. Every such field is typed `number | null`. Work-order counts became real on
 *    2026-09-03; the report count has not.
 * 3. **Authorisation happens here, not only at the route** (2.3.4). The route calls it too; putting
 *    it in the control class means a second caller — a scheduled export, a test — cannot bypass it.
